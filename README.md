# Job-Router


This project is a very cool(IMHO) job-search-engine amalgamation combining the top 7 leading web sites and delivering location-specific, centralized data for easy navigation and profile tracking. 

## Note-worthy source code:
For data gathering intricacies: /dataCalls

For UI components: /app/src/Components

For server-side data normalization: /controllers

## Hosted site information:
For hosted site: http://job-router.herokuapp.com/

Note: This site relies on complex functions to deliver accurate results. Over time, the sources providing data will, inevitably, alter their information slightly, as do all regularly maintained websites. At this time, this project is not actively maintained, so the algorithms delivering specific information may vary slightly. If you like the project and see any information that has not been correctly delivered, feel free to let me know and I would be happy to take a look.
